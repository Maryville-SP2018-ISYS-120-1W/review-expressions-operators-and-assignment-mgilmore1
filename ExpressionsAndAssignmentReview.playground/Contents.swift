/* Overview
 
 Your assignment is to create your own programming problem using variables, operators, and assignment. Think about the Operators playground you completed. This assignment is like you are producing a page for that assignment. You will work on your playground page in a playground cloned from GitHub. It should include *at least* the following:
 
 - three arithmetic operators
 - one compound operator
 - three variables
 - one type conversion
 
 It's not very exciting to have a bunch of random numbers in code. When writing this problem you should be creating a story around it. This need not be tremendously complex, just a simple story that motivates the values being used and gives them a context.
 
 For example 40 / 5 isn't interesting, but writing a tree planting app that given a species of tree and how much space you have will estimate how many trees you can plant is moreso. (e.g., I have 40 sq ft and want to plant walnut trees. They need 5 sq ft of growing space around the trunk, how many can I fit?).
 
 You should write your story bits in comments (e.g., between /* and */, or lines starting with // ) around where the code should go.

/*
You are an exterminator. You are going to be building an application to help you keep track of how many vermin you have disposed. to start off declare a constant named ratRate with a value of 5.6. this will be the rate you charge per rat you kill. additionaly create a variable called deadRats set to 0
 */



/*
 You start your day by finding a small bundle of vermin and deal with them. Add 3 to deadRats and print your result.
 */




/*
you find another group of rats and double your kill count. double deadRats using multiplication and print your result.
 */


/*
 In your excitement to find so many rats you dont finish the job properly and two rate pop up from playing dead and scurry awway. Adjust deadRats using a compound opporator to reflect the loss of these 2 rats and print your result.
 */

/*
Finnaly it's the end of the day and time to get paid. create a variable called pay and set it to the result of deadRats times ratRate. Does the code compile? use a temporary type conversion to assign deadRats as a double and print your result.
